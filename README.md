Real-Time Tennis Analytics with YOLO and CNN
## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI system with YOLO for player and ball detection and a custom CNN for court mapping, delivering real-time analytics to optimise strategies and identify performance gaps

## Sample Output
Here's a sample frame taken from one of the processed videos, demonstrating how the analysis functions:



### Pre-Trained Models
- **Player Detection Model:** 
- **Court Key Point Model:**



### Installing the Dependencies
1. **Create a Conda Environment:**
   Run the following command in your terminal or Anaconda prompt to create a new Conda environment named `tennis_analysis` with Python 3.8:
   ```bash
   conda create -n tennis_analysis python=3.8
   ```
   
2. **Activate the Environment:**
   
  Once created, activate your new environment using:
  ```bash
  conda activate tennis_analysis
  ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   
  install the required packages using the requirements.txt file:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
